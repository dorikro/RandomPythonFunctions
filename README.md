# Cloudwatch alarm creation for DX connection status
This function creates CloudWatch alarms for Direct Connect status by monitoring the ConnectionState metric in the AWS/DirectConnect namespace. The list of connections to monitor is defined at the beginning of the function. The metric threshold is set to 0.0 to trigger an alarm when the connection state is not 'available'. The LessThanThreshold comparison operator is used to trigger the alarm.

The function creates a CloudWatch alarm for each Direct Connect connection in the list using the put_metric_alarm method. The alarm name and description are set based on the connection ID and metric name. The alarm is triggered if the connection state is not 'available'. An SNS topic is specified as the alarm action to notify administrators when the alarm is triggered.

Note that you'll need to replace the SNS topic ARN with your own SNS topic ARN in the AlarmActions parameter for the alarms to be sent to the appropriate SNS topic.



## To use the Python script, you can follow these general steps:

### Install the Boto3 library: 
If you don't already have it, you can install it using pip by running the following command: pip install boto3.

### Configure AWS credentials: 
The Boto3 library requires AWS credentials to access AWS services. You can set up credentials using environment variables, an AWS profile, or an IAM role.

### Save the script: 
Save the Python script to a file with a .py extension, for example cloudwatch_alarms.py.

### Update the script: 
Update the script to include the correct resource IDs, metric names, namespaces, and alarm actions for your specific use case.

### Run the script: 
You can run the script locally on your machine by executing the command python cloudwatch_alarms.py. Alternatively, you can deploy the script to an AWS Lambda function, which you can then trigger using various AWS services.

### Verify alarms: 
After the script runs, you should be able to see the newly created CloudWatch alarms in the AWS Management Console under the CloudWatch service. You can also test the alarms by manually modifying the resources in such a way that the alarm threshold is exceeded.

* Note that this is a general overview of how to use the Python script to create CloudWatch alarms. The specific details of how to configure AWS credentials and how to run the script may vary depending on your specific use case and development environment.
